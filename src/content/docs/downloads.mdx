#### Notes

##### For Windows users
:::note
Windows Defender might alert you about a threat in the SocNetV Windows installer. This is a false positive as the installer is automatically created in [Appveyor CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/oxy86/app/builds/47285253) and checked with VirusTotal. Our installer is 100% safe. For your peace of mind, scan the installed files with Defender to verify them for yourself.
:::


##### For macOS users
:::note
The first time you run the SocNetV app or the installer, macOS may tell you that it cannot verify the software developer/publisher. That's because we do not sign our released packages with any code signing certificates. Please press Cancel, not Move to Bin! Then, right-click again on the app (while pressing the Ctrl key) and select Open to run the application normally. To install SocNetV, just drag the app icon to your Applications folder.
:::

##### For Linux users
:::note
SocNetV is also available in [the repositories of most Linux distributions](https://repology.org/project/socnetv/versions). However, this is not always the most recent version. We urge you to use the AppImage of the latest version available from this page. Users of openSUSE, Fedora, and Ubuntu/Debian may also add our own repositories to their systems and automatically update to the latest SocNetV version through the package manager (i.e., `apt-get install socnetv`). If you do not know how to add our repositories, please read the [Instructions](../docs/intro.html#Ubuntu) in the Manual.

### Development Version

:::caution
Warning: The development code branch is not always stable. Use at your own risk!
:::

If you are looking for the cutting edge, there are also binaries of the development version in GH releases ('continuous' tag).

<LinkButton href="https://github.com/socnetv/app/releases/tag/continuous" variant="secondary">
Get the development binaries
</LinkButton>

Alternatively, you can clone the development branch (called "develop") of the SocNetV code on your computer with this git command:

```bash
git clone -b develop --single-branch https://github.com/socnetv/app.git socnetv
```

A new directory called socnetv will be created. To build the development version, install the Qt5 libraries, and then change directory into socnetv:

```bash
cd socnetv
```
Enter the following commands to compile it:

```bash
qmake
make
```

If you have Qt6 installed, a binary file named socnetv (or socnetv.exe) will be created. You can run it by:

Linux/macOS: 
```bash
./socnetv
```

Windows: 
```bash
socnetv.exe
```
