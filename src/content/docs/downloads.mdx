### Notes

#### Note for Windows users
Windows Defender might alert you about a threat in the SocNetV Windows installer. This is a false positive as the installer is automatically created in [Appveyor CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/oxy86/app/builds/47285253) and checked with VirusTotal. Our installer is 100% safe. For your peace of mind, scan the installed files with Defender to verify them for yourself.

#### Note for macOS users
The first time you run the SocNetV app or the installer, macOS may tell you that it cannot verify the software developer/publisher. That's because we do not sign our released packages with any code signing certificates. Please press Cancel, not Move to Bin! Then, right-click again on the app (while pressing the Ctrl key) and select Open to run the application normally. To install SocNetV, just drag the app icon to your Applications folder.

#### Note for Linux users
SocNetV is also available in [the repositories of most Linux distributions](https://repology.org/project/socnetv/versions). However, this is not always the most recent version. We urge you to use the AppImage of the latest version available from this page. Users of openSUSE, Fedora, and Ubuntu/Debian may also add our own repositories to their systems and automatically update to the latest SocNetV version through the package manager (i.e., `apt-get install socnetv`). If you do not know how to add our repositories, please read the [Instructions](../docs/intro.html#Ubuntu) in the Manual.

### Source Code

[Download Zipped Archive](https://github.com/socnetv/app/archive/master.zip)

To compile the source code, please see the [Instructions](http://socnetv.org/docs/intro.html#Compile).

### Development Version

Warning: The development code branch is not always stable. Use at your own risk!

You can clone the development branch (called "develop") of the SocNetV code on your computer with this git command:

```bash
git clone -b develop --single-branch https://github.com/socnetv/app.git socnetv
```

A new directory called socnetv will be created. To build the development version, install the Qt5 libraries, and then change directory into socnetv:

```bash
cd socnetv
```
Enter the following commands to compile it:
```bash
qmake
make
```

If you have Qt5 installed, a binary file named socnetv (or socnetv.exe) will be created. You can run it by:

```bash
    Linux/macOS: ./socnetv
    Windows: socnetv.exe
```
