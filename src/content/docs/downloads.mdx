#### Notes

##### For Windows users
:::note
Windows Defender might alert you about a threat in the SocNetV Windows installer. This is a false positive as the installer is automatically created by [Github Actions Workflow](https://github.com/socnetv/app/actions/runs/22411624409) and checked with VirusTotal. Our installer is 100% safe. For your peace of mind, scan the installed files with Defender to verify them for yourself.
Also, the OS/browser might tell you that it cannot verify the software developer/publisher and suggest you move the installer to Trash! That's because we do not sign our released packages with MS developer signing certificates...
:::

##### For Linux users
:::note
Besides the official release packages, SocNetV can also be installed via a Launchpad PPA (Ubuntu 22.04+). OpenSUSE Build Service (OBS) repositories are coming soon.
See the [installation details](/manual/intro#installation-instructions) for details.
