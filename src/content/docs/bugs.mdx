Found a bug in Social Network Visualizer? Did it crash?

Report it to us so that we can fix it as soon as possible!

To help us triage and fix the bug, we need a meaningful bug report. To do this:
1. Run SocNetV from a terminal.
2. Open **Settings**, enable **Print debug messages...**, and repeat the steps that lead to the bug.
3. SocNetV will print debug messages in the terminal. Copy the last few lines of these messagesâ€”this is essential for your bug report!

Then, post your bug report in our bug tracker on GitHub. Click the button below to report the bug now (you must be logged in):

[Report a bug now!](https://github.com/socnetv/app/issues/new)

Please describe the bug in as much detail as possible. At least, include the exact steps you took that led to the bug or crash.
