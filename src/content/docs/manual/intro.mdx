## What is Social Network Analysis?

A _Social Network_ is the social structure that facilitates communication between a group of _actors_ (individuals or organizations) that are related somehow (i.e., by common interests, shared values, financial exchanges, friendship, dislike, etc).

For instance, your friends and you form a social network.  
But social networks operate on many more levels, from family relations and disease spreading up to the level of company strategies, social movements, or even nations.

Furthermore, research in many scientific areas has shown that social networks are important when studying how problems are solved, diseases are spread, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals.

_Social Network Analysis_ (SNA) is a beautiful blend of Sociology and Mathematics, composed of various interdisciplinary techniques for studying such social networks.

SNA researchers conceptualize social relationships in terms of _nodes_ and _edges_ (links) in _mathematical graphs_.

- **Nodes** represent the individual _actors_ within the networks.
- **Edges** visualize the relationships between those actors.

The result is graph-based structures, often complex to understand and analyze. This is where applications like SocNetV are needed.

## What is SocNetV?

Social Network Visualizer (SocNetV) is an open-source project to build a flexible and user-friendly, cross-platform [tool for social network analysis and visualization](https://socnetv.org), targeting primarily the social researcher. It is developed in C++ and Qt, an open-source development toolkit, and runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

SocNetV supports the creation and analysis of multirelational networks in the GraphML format. This capability allows users to define and visualize multiple types of relationships (edges) between nodes within the same network. Each relation is stored as a distinct layer, making it easy to switch between, analyze, and compare different relationship types. This multirelational support is particularly useful for complex datasets, such as networks involving family ties, professional connections, or transactional links, all within a single unified GraphML file.

### Features of SocNetV

1. **Graph Construction**  
   Use an easy-to-use GUI to construct social networks, or load networks in various formats (GraphML, GraphViz, Adjacency, EdgeList, Pajek, UCINET, GML, etc). Random networks can also be generated using models like:
   - Barabási–Albert Scale-Free
   - Erdős–Rényi
   - Watts-Strogatz Small-World  
   See more in the [Random Networks](/manual/generate#random-network-creation) section.

2. **Metrics Computation**  
   Compute standard graph theory and network cohesion metrics, such as:
   - Density
   - Diameter
   - Geodesic distances
   - Clustering coefficient  
   See details in the [Cohesion Metrics](/manual/analysis#cohesion-measures) section.

3. **Structural Statistics**  
   Analyze network centrality and prestige metrics:
   - Betweenness centrality
   - Eigenvector centrality
   - Closeness centrality
   - PageRank prestige  
   Explore these metrics in the [Centralities](/manual/analysis#centralities-and-prestige) section.

4. **Community Detection**  
   Use fast algorithms for detecting communities, including:
   - Triad census
   - Clique census  
   Learn more in the [Communities](/manual/analysis#community-detection) section.

5. **Structural Equivalence Analysis**  
   Perform hierarchical clustering, actor similarity, and tie profile dissimilarity analysis.  
   See more in [Structural Equivalence](/manual/analysis#structural-equivalence-methods).

6. **Visualization Models**  
   Visualize networks using layout algorithms:
   - Radial
   - Level-based
   - Nodal sizes by centrality score
   - Force-directed placement (Kamada-Kawai, Fruchterman-Reingold)  
   Learn more in the [Visualization](/manual/visualization) section.

## Installation Instructions

SocNetV is multi-platform, which means that it can be installed and run in every Operating System supported by the Qt toolkit.

In fact, the project offers binaries and installers for the three major Operating Systems:

* Windows, 
* macOS 
* Linux

The latest release of SocNetV can be downloaded from the project's [Downloads](/downloads) page.

If there is no binary package for your OS, please download and compile the source code,
as explained below.

### Install in Windows

To install SocNetV in Windows, download the latest SocNetV Windows installer from
the [Downloads](/downloads) page, and double-click on the executable to start the installation.

:::note
You might see a Windows pop up about unknown software origin/publisher. Please ignore it and proceed, as we do not sign our released packages with any code signing certificates (which are not free by the way). 
:::

Click Next and Accept the License (GPL) to install the program.

The program will be installed in the usual Windows Program Files directory and a new
Start Menu shortcut will be created.

Afterwards you can run the application from your Start menu.

### Install in macOS

To install SocNetV in macOS, download the latest SocNetV macOS package from
the [Downloads](https://socnetv.org/downloads) page. Then right-click on it and select Open.

If the package is an installer, the installation will start immediately and the application 
will be installed automatically in your Applications.

Otherwise, if the package is just an macOS image disk (a file with a `.dmg` extension), then double-click on it to open it. 
You will see a new window with the SocNetV executable icon inside. Right-click on it and select Open to run the application. 

:::note
The first time you will run SocNetV, macOS may tell you that it cannot verify the software developer/publisher. That's because we do not sign our released packages with any code signing certificates (which are not free by the way). 
Please press Cancel, not Move to Bin! Then, right-click again on SocNetV app and select Open to run the application normally.  
:::

After that, in order to permanently install SocNetV in your macOS, you can simply drag the SocNetV executable icon into your Applications.

Alternatively, there is a SocNetV port in MacPorts (thanks to Szabolcs Horvát!). It can be installed with the command:

```bash
port install socnetv
```

### Install in Linux

To run the latest and greatest version of SocNetV in Linux, download the latest Linux AppImage from
the [Downloads](/downloads) page.

Then, make the .appimage file executable and double-click on it to run SocNetV. That's it. :)

:::note
Please note that SocNetV is also available in the [repositories of most Linux distributions](https://repology.org/project/socnetv/versions). 
However, that is not always the most recent version. We urge you to use the AppImage of the latest version available from our website instead.
:::

### Development Version

To test the latest development version of SocNetV, download the CI/CD binaries from the `continuous` tag in our GH releases:

<LinkButton href="https://github.com/socnetv/app/releases/tag/continuous" variant="secondary">
Get the development binaries
</LinkButton>


:::caution
Warning: The development code branch is not always stable. Use at your own risk!
:::

Alternatively, you can clone the development branch (called "develop") of the SocNetV code on your computer with this git command:

```bash
git clone -b develop --single-branch https://github.com/socnetv/app.git socnetv
```

A new directory called socnetv will be created. To build the development version, install the Qt5 libraries, and then change directory into socnetv:

```bash
cd socnetv
```

Enter the following commands to compile it:

```bash
qmake
make
```

## Command line options


If you run SocNetV from the command prompt, there are three (at the moment) options:
`--version | -V`      Displays the version of the program.

`--help | -H` 	      Displays a short help message.

`file.net`	      The name of the file you want to open.
