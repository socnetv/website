## Working with SocNetV

Below, we describe how to work with SocNetV.

---

### Network Creation

To start working with SocNetV, you need network data, i.e., a graph of nodes (vertices) and links (edges).
You can load a network from a file or "draw" nodes and edges by pointing and clicking on the canvas.

Ways to Create/Edit Nodes and Links:

- From the menus.
- Using the keyboard
- By right/left/middle/double-clicking on the canvas.

---

### Creating and Handling Nodes

To create a new node:
- Double-click on the canvas.
- Click on the "Add Node" toolbar button.
- Press `CTRL+.`

You can move a node by dragging it with the left mouse button. When dragging a node, SocNetV highlights all its adjacent edges.

Right-clicking on a node opens a context menu to:
- Delete the node.
- Add an edge.
- Change node properties (e.g., color, size, label).

All nodes are tagged with their node number by default. To display labels, enable the option in `Options` -> `Node` -> `Display Labels`.

In large networks, finding specific nodes can be challenging. Use `CTRL+F` to search for nodes by number or label. Press `CTRL+F` again to undo the highlight.

From the **Node Properties** dialog, you can:
- Enter a node label.
- Adjust size.
- Select a color.
- Change the shape (e.g., rectangle, diamond, ellipse, circle).

#### Group Selection
To select multiple nodes:
- Hold the left mouse button and drag to create a selection rectangle.
- All nodes inside the rectangle are selected.
- Right-click one of the selected nodes to edit all selected nodes together in the **Node Properties** dialog.

:::caution 
In networks with thousands of edges, group selection may be slow.
:::

---

### Creating and Editing Edges

To create an edge:
- Middle-click or double-click on the source node, then do the same on the target node.

By default:
- New links have a weight of `w = 1`.
- You can change the weight by right-clicking on the edge and selecting "Change Weight."

:::note
Edge widths are proportional to their weight using the formula:  
  $ \text{width} = 1 + \log(1 + \log |weight|) $.
:::

You can also create edges using:
- **Right-click**: Select "Create Edge" and specify the source/target node and edge weight in the dialog.
- **Control Panel**: Click the "Add Edge" button and enter source/target nodes and weight.
- **Keyboard**: Press `CTRL+/` to specify source/target nodes and weight.

#### Example
Create a directed edge from Node 1 to Node 2:
- Middle-click on Node 1 (the mouse pointer becomes a hand).
- Middle-click on Node 2.  
  A new line appears, indicating the directed edge.

:::note
Clicking on an edge highlights its source and target nodes. Click again to undo the highlight.
:::

---

### Relations

When you create your first edge, SocNetV asks you to name the relationship (e.g., "friendship").  
A **relation** represents a specific type of tie between nodes.

- **Multi-relational networks**: SocNetV supports networks with multiple types of ties (e.g., friendships and business relationships).
- Add new relations using the `+` button in the toolbar.
- Navigate between relations using the arrow buttons in the toolbar.

:::note
While modifying multi-relational networks, you can add nodes but cannot remove them.
:::


:::caution
SocNetV saves only the active relation when saving a network to a format other than GraphML. To save all relations, use GraphML.
:::

---

### Basic Functions in the Network Menu

#### Loading a Network

To load network data in a supported format (e.g., GraphML, GML, Pajek):
1. Select `File -> Load`.
2. Use the file dialog to navigate to your file.

For unsupported formats, use `File -> Import`.

##### File Previewer
When loading a file, SocNetV shows a **File Previewer**, allowing you to:
- Adjust the file's codepage (e.g., UTF-8, Windows-1253).
- Ensure proper display of non-Latin characters.

![File Previewer](https://socnetv.org/data/uploads/screenshots/25/socnetv-25-file-preview.jpg)  
*In the File Previewer, select a codepage for the opened file.*

> **Note**:  
> - The default codepage is UTF-8.  
> - Use other codepages (e.g., KOI8-R for Russian) only if necessary.

---

#### Saving a Network

To save the active network:
- Press `CTRL+S` or select `File -> Save`.

Default format: **GraphML**.  
Export to other formats via `Network -> Export To`.

:::note
UTF-8 is the default codec for saving files.
:::

---

#### Viewing or Plotting the Adjacency Matrix

- Press `F6` to view the adjacency matrix.  
  Each element $ a(i, j) $ represents the weight of the edge from node $ i $ to node $ j $. $ a(i, j) = 0 $ if there is no edge.
- Press `Shift+F6` to plot the adjacency matrix.
