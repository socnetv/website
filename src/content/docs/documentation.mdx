The documentation of Social Network Visualizer is a manual maintained in HTML format. It covers pretty much everything you need to know about social network analysis methods, network layout algorithms used by SocNetV, supported social network formats, graph creation, generation of random networks, automatic regeneration of famous data sets, etc. Click the link below to go to the Manual:

:::note
If you prefer to read the code, you can either go to [**SocNetV repository**](https://github.com/socnetv/app) or perhaps checkout the [**code annotation**](/docs/index.html).

Also, there is a [Software Requirements Specification document (PDF format)](/SRS-Documentation-SocNetV.pdf) for Social Network Visualizer. Vaggelis Motesnitsalis was kind enough to prepare and contribute it. Please note that this PDF document refers to an older version.
