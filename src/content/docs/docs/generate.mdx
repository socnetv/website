# Network Generation




This page provides information about the network generation routines and capabilities of SocNetV. The application can recreate famous social network analysis datasets (e.g., Knoke: Bureaucracies Network) or generate random networks using graph theory models such as the Barabási–Albert model for scale-free networks and the Watts-Strogatz model for small-world networks.

SocNetV can also create "networks" of linked webpages using the built-in Web Crawler, which maps hypertext links between webpages starting from a given webpage or website.

## Datasets: Recreating Famous Datasets

SocNetV can recreate several well-known social network datasets, including:

- **Krackhardt**: High-tech managers (advice, friendship, and "reports-to" relationships), 24 actors.
- **Padgett**: Florentine Families (marital and business relationships), 16 actors.
- **Zachary**: Karate Club (simple and weighted ties), 34 actors.
- **Bernard**: Killworth Fraternity (multirelational), 58 actors.
- **Galaskiewicz**: CEOs and clubs (affiliation data).
- **Freeman's EIES**: Multirelational network with 32 actors.
- **Knoke**: Bureaucracies Network (information and money relations), 10 actors.
- **Mexican Power Network**: Power structures in the 1940s.
- And many more...

To recreate a dataset:
1. From the **File** menu, select "Create Known Dataset" or press `F7`.
2. A dialog will appear where you can select a dataset from the list above.
3. Press "OK," and the selected network will be displayed on the canvas.

## Random Network Creation

SocNetV can generate random networks based on various graph theory models, including:

### Scale-Free (S-F) Networks

A scale-free network has a degree distribution that follows a power law. Actors with degrees much higher than average are common and are known as "hubs."

The probability $P(k)$ that a node has degree $k$ is:

$$
P(k) \sim k^{-\gamma}
$$

where $\gamma$ typically satisfies $2 < \gamma < 3$.

SocNetV generates scale-free networks using the Barabási–Albert (BA) model. The algorithm begins with $m_0$ connected nodes. In each step, a new node is added with $m$ edges. The probability $p_i$ that the new node connects to an existing node $i$ is:

$$
p_i = \frac{\alpha + d_i^p}{\sum_j d_j}
$$

where:
- $\alpha$: Initial attractiveness of each node.
- $d_i$: Degree of node $i$.
- $\sum_j d_j$: Sum of all node degrees.

If $\alpha = 0$ and $p = 1$, the preferential attachment is linear, which corresponds to the BA model.

### Small-World (SW) Networks

Small-world networks are characterized by short average path lengths and high clustering. SocNetV uses the Watts-Strogatz model to generate such networks.

Given $N$ nodes, mean degree $K$ (even integer), and a rewiring probability $\beta$, the model generates an undirected graph as follows:

1. Create a regular ring lattice with $N$ nodes, each connected to $K/2$ neighbors on each side.
2. For each edge $(n_i, n_j)$ with $i < j$, rewire it with probability $\beta$. Rewiring replaces $(n_i, n_j)$ with $(n_i, n_k)$, where $k$ is chosen uniformly, avoiding self-loops ($k \neq i$) and duplicate edges.

To generate a small-world network, go to **Network > Create Random Network > Small World**, then specify the number of nodes ($N$), mean degree ($K$), and rewiring probability ($\beta$).

### Erdős–Rényi (ER) Networks

The Erdős–Rényi model generates random networks based on either of two modes:

1. $G(n, M)$: A graph with $n$ nodes and $M$ edges, where all graphs are equally likely.
2. $G(n, p)$: A graph where each edge is present with probability $p$, independent of other edges.

To create an ER network:
1. Go to **Network > Create Random Network > Erdos-Renyi**.
2. Specify the number of nodes ($n$) and either the edge probability ($p$) or the number of edges ($M$).
3. Choose whether the network is directed, undirected, or allows self-loops.

### Lattice Networks

SocNetV can generate regular lattice networks with arbitrary dimensions $d$, size $l$ for each dimension, and custom neighborhood size $n$, which defines the distance within which neighbors are connected.

---

### Ring Lattices

Ring lattices are a type of network where nodes are arranged in a ring, each connected to $d/2$ neighbors on either side. For example, in a 4-lattice of 10 nodes, node 6 connects to nodes 4, 5, 7, and 8.

To create a ring lattice network, go to **Network > Create Random Network > Ring Lattice**, then specify the number of nodes and degree $d$.

## Web Crawler: Networks of Webpages

SocNetV includes a web crawler that creates networks of linked webpages. Starting from an initial URL, the crawler:
- Downloads the HTML of the page.
- Extracts all links (`href`) to other pages (internal or external).
- Adds these links as nodes and edges in the resulting network.

To use the web crawler:
1. Go to **Network > Web Crawler** or press `Shift+C`.
2. Enter the initial URL and configure limits, such as:
   - Maximum URLs to crawl (total nodes in the network).
   - Maximum links per page to consider.
3. Specify patterns to include or exclude and the type of links to follow (internal, external, or both). Add delays between requests to prevent overloading servers.

Press "OK" to begin crawling.
