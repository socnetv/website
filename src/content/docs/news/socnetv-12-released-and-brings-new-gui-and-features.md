### Redesigned Conceptualization of Prominence

SocNetV now distinguishes between **Centrality indices** and **Prestige indices**, following frameworks by Wasserman & Faust and Knoke & Burt:

- **Centrality Indices** (for undirected graphs or outLinks in digraphs):
  - Degree Centrality (DC)
  - Closeness Centrality (CC)
  - Influence Range Closeness Centrality (IRCC)
  - Betweeness Centrality (BC)
  - Stress Centrality (SC)
  - Eccentricity Centrality (EC)
  - Power Centrality (PC)
  - Information Centrality (IC)

- **Prestige Indices** (for directed graphs, focusing on inLinks):
  - Degree Prestige (DP)
  - Proximity Prestige (PP)
