After nine years of relying on plain HTML files for our web presence, it was time for the **Social Network Visualizer (SocNetV)** website to receive a modern overhaul. We've transitioned to the open-source **GetSimple CMS**, which offers a completely text-based, fast, and user-friendly experience.

The new design is based on a heavily modified version of the "my-company" theme, bringing a clean and professional look to the site.

### Highlights of the Update

- A new and improved [**News Section**](https://socnetv.org/news/) with historical content, allowing visitors to scroll through older updates.
- A comprehensive [**Screenshots Gallery**](https://socnetv.org/screenshots/) showcasing SocNetV in action from its early days to the latest features.

We hope you enjoy the revamped website and find it easier to navigate and explore!
