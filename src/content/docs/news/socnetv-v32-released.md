### SocNetV v3.2 released! 🎉

We are excited to announce the release of **SocNetV v3.2**, the latest version of our cross-platform social network analysis and visualization software.

This new release introduces some powerful features and important improvements aimed at enhancing your research workflows and making network modeling even easier.

### 🔍 What’s New in SocNetV v3.2?

**🧩 Custom node attributes (metadata)**  
You can now define and manage **custom metadata** for nodes directly through the **Node Properties dialog**. This allows for a more flexible and descriptive representation of your network data — great for researchers who want to attach additional information to each actor.

**📊 Node labels in adjacency matrix files**  
SocNetV v3.2 introduces **support for node labels** when reading adjacency matrix-formatted files. That means better interoperability with external tools and datasets, and no more guessing who node "3" is supposed to be.

**🔧 A modernized build system**  
We've moved to a **CMake-based build system**, which simplifies compilation and packaging across platforms. Whether you're building from source on Linux, macOS, or Windows, the process is now more standard and maintainable.

**🎯 Updated Filter Edges by Weight**  
The **Filter Edges by Weight** functionality has been revamped for improved usability and consistency. It's now easier to focus on the strongest (or weakest) connections in your networks.

**🐛 Tons of bug fixes**  
From UI tweaks to core algorithm improvements, v3.2 resolves numerous bugs reported by our users. You can explore the full list of closed issues in the [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/socnetv/app/issues?q=is%3Aissue+state%3Aclosed+milestone%3A3.2).
