Can you use **SocNetV** to analyze a virtual "social network"? Yes, you can! For instance, you could analyze social interactions (e.g., mentions) between "friends" in a virtual network. Although SocNetV cannot directly grab data from private networks (its built-in web crawler is limited to publicly accessible data), if you extract the network data yourself and transform it into **GraphML** format, SocNetV can load and visualize the virtual network for analysis.

This approach is particularly useful for platforms like [**Dolphin**](http://www.boonex.com), an open-source platform for social networks, and its mobile-friendly sibling [**Trident**](http://www.online.me). These platforms support social connections, conversations, locations, and other social graph-related data types, which can be analyzed using SocNetV based on operator needs.

### Example Use Case

Imagine an airline company launches a social network for its clients. By using SocNetV to analyze connections, discussion trends, and user posts, the company could:

- Identify which routes are in demand.
- Plan and optimize scheduling based on social data.
- Target specific user segments with special offers.
- Advertise these offers directly within the social network.

This innovative application of SocNetV showcases its potential as an "intelligence" source for network operators, enabling data-driven decision-making and enhanced user engagement.

Kudos to the Dolphin and Trident teams for exploring this exciting use case for SocNetV!
