Over the last weeks, the **Social Networks Visualizer (SocNetV)** project has released two new versions that bring useful features and bugfixes. The latest **v1.4** closes even 4-year-old bugs!

## Multirelational Editing

One of the strongest new features in SocNetV v1.4 is **multirelational editing**. Now, you can:

1. Load or create a network (e.g., friendship ties in a classroom).
2. Add a new relation (e.g., "likes") using **Ctrl+Shift+N** or the `+` button.

Easily switch between relations, analyze, and visualize them. For example, apply a **circular layout** based on **Betweenness Centrality** to one relation and compare it with another relation's **node size** visualization.

## Loading and Saving Multirelational Networks

- SocNetV now supports loading **multirelational networks** (e.g., UCINET formatted files).
- However, when saving, each relation must be saved individually. This will be improved in future versions.

For example, you can test this feature with the **Freemanâ€™s EIES networks dataset**.

## Memory Optimizations

SocNetV v1.4 is optimized for low memory consumption and speed:

- Handles networks with **1000 actors and 10,000 edges** in seconds.
- Consumes less than **400MB RAM**.

## Additional Enhancements

- Improved **visualization layouts** (circular and nodal size based on prominence indices).
- Faster analysis of large datasets with new tools like **Triad Census** and **Geodesic Matrix**.

## Bugs Fixed

Version 1.4 addresses several bugs (see the [ChangeLog](https://socnetv.org/ChangeLog)) and introduces stability improvements. However, testing and feedback are always welcome to ensure the best user experience.
