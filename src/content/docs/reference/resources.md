description: A reference page for all things SocNetV
---

This is a reference page. Here we gather all things about SocNetV. 

- The [**code**](https://github.com/socnetv).
- The [**code annotation**](/docs/index.html).
- The [Software Requirements Specification document (PDF format)](/SRS-Documentation-SocNetV.pdf) for Social Network Visualizer. Vaggelis Motesnitsalis was kind enough to prepare and contribute it. Please note that this PDF document refers to an older version.
